# Project Life Cycle

Usually sign is related to project. To make an order it is best that we attach sign into a project, then we can easily make an order by project. Let say as a customer when he/she done create and design a sign than what should they do? based this [list](https://skilt.bdsamferdsel.no/settings/statuses).

1. Sign that have ``Kladd`` or ``Revisjon`` status can't be included in order.
2. To make an order, sign should have status ``Ferdig``.
3. Admin should approved (``Godkjent``) that sign.
4. Make an order number based approved Project/Sign.
5. Finished the order with exporting the Project/Sign.
6. After Project/Sign is exported then it will be moved to ``Arkiv``.
7. Project/Sign that in ``Arkiv`` can be restored to ``Kladd`` or ``Revisjon`` and the order number will be deleted.
