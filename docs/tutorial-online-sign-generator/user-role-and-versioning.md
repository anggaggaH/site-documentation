# User Role

Soon we will have two user roles, ``Admin`` and ``Regular User``. This role that will strict access at some pages and function.

We also have the ``Project Owner`` and ``Participant`` to be able to make some changes to the road sign generator.

# Versioning

Sign versioning can help track and monitor changes made to your files over time. This can be useful for auditing purposes and for tracking the progress of a project sign. It's particularly helpful when you're working on a project with multiple people, as you can see who made what changes and when.
