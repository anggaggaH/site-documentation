# Export

Each sign will have two exported version with and without measurement each svg configuration can be found at:
1. ``SvgOutputDownload`` file.
2. ``SvgMeasurement`` file.

The reason why we use two different format it is because we need both format on `PDF` format.

There is extra configuration for Svg with measurement, each sign file should have return extra element with measurement configuration, also there is a lot of path configuration at ``SvgMeasurement`` file to determine how the measurement path is.
