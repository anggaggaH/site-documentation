# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **What we should do in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **installing**.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**
- **[Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm)**
- **[Nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)**


for node and npm version each project will have their recommended version.

### What you'll need

- Access to [Repo](https://gitlab.baezeni.net/dashboard/projects/)

## Clone Project

Clone a project site using git.

The project source will automatically be added to your machine after you run the command:

```bash
git clone project-url
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor. Followed by typing

```bash
npm install
```

The command will installs all necessary dependencies you need to run The Project.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd your-project-source
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Project site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
